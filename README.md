# 🧠 Cancer Data Analysis Application with Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a simple, end-to-end Python application that performs **data analysis** and **machine learning classification** on a cancer dataset. Using tools like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`, the application allows users to explore the data, train a supervised learning model, and make predictions through an interactive interface.

Dataset used: `Cancer_Data.csv`
